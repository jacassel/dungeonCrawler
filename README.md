# dungeonCrawler
This is the repository for my RPG game that I am building in C++
I use three classes in this project which are the following:
Plot: This holds all of the narrative for the RPG game and gathers information from the player such as their name.
Hero: As the name suggests this holds the player's avatar with all of their stats as the progress through the game.
Monster: This class holds all of the enemies that the hero has to fight.
The purpose of this project is threefold:
1. As an expression of my passion for software development, I was not required to make this project.
2. A way of growing my skills in C++ and in Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
3. Seizing the opportunity to build a great RPG game that is fun to play as a personal project.
